* make sure that we always have a pinned item (there's probably a case where we have a pinned event in the state but it doesn't match any of the `events`, probably when we flush events)
* run only in dev mode (if window is defined + register variable via content script)
* empty page + just disable the controls when there's no events (do not hide everything)
